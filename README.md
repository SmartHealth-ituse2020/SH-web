# SmartHealth Project - Web Application

> SmartHealth provides a hypertension prediction from ECG and PPG data of
patients. It helps doctors to diagnose the hypertension at early stages.

Electronic medical records (EMRs) took the place of paper to store the healthcare data. EMRs create a field for data scientists to work on.  These records give significant information about the health of the patient. Combining EMR data with artificial intelligence, we will learn what causes the diseases such as high blood pressure. The thingslearned will be used to speed up the diagnosis process and help doctors to provide personalized treatments.
